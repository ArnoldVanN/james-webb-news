# James Webb news API
This is a passion project consisting of an Express API and Gatsby Front-end.
It makes use of RSS feeds and web scraping to gather articles about the James Webb Space Telescope.

A WIP build of this project is currently live at https://arnoldvann.github.io/james-webb-news/

## How to run
After cloning the repo, install the dependencies for the back end project by running `npm install` in the base directory. Make sure to run `npm start` in the back end project first. This starts the API server which is required to build the Gatsby project.\
Then `cd` into the front end directory (james-webb-api-frontend) and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
